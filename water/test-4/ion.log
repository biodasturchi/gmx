Using SIMD 4x4 nonbonded short-range kernels

Using a dual 4x4 pair-list setup updated with dynamic pruning:
  outer list: updated every 50 steps, buffer 0.113 nm, rlist 1.113 nm
  inner list: updated every 12 steps, buffer 0.001 nm, rlist 1.001 nm
At tolerance 0.005 kJ/mol/ps per atom, equivalent classical 1x1 list would be:
  outer list: updated every 50 steps, buffer 0.242 nm, rlist 1.242 nm
  inner list: updated every 12 steps, buffer 0.047 nm, rlist 1.047 nm
